# Polar Wind Plot Image Generator for WeeWX

## Description
The Polar Wind Plot Image Generator is a WeeWX extension that generates polar plots of wind related observations from WeeWX archive data. The polar plots are generated as image files suitable for publishing on a web page, inclusion in a WeeWX template or for use elsewhere.

The extension consists of a single WeeWX skin that controls a custom image generator. Various image parameters including the plot type, period, source data field, units of measure and colours can be controlled through user controlled settings.
