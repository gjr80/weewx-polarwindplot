# Polar Wind Plot Image Generator Extension

## Description
The *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* extension is a WeeWX extension that generates polar plots of wind related observations from WeeWX archive data. The polar plots are generated as image files suitable for publishing on a web page, inclusion in a WeeWX template or for use elsewhere.

The extension consists of a single WeeWX skin that controls a custom image generator. Various parameters including the plot type, period, source data field, units of measure and colours are available to allow customisation of the generated output.

## Pre-requisites

The *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* extension requires WeeWX v3.2.0 or greater and will operate under  Python 2 or Python 3.

## Installation Instructions

To install the *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* extension:

1.  Download the latest *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* extension from the *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* extension [releases page](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-polarwindplot/releases) into a directory accessible from the WeeWX machine.

        $ wget -P /var/tmp https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-polarwindplot/releases/download/v0.1.0/polarwindplot-0.1.0.tar.gz

2.  Install the *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* extension:

        $ wee_extension --install=/var/tmp/polarwindplot-0.1.0.tar.gz

    **Note:** Depending on your system/installation the above command may need to be prefixed with *sudo*.

    **Note:** Depending on your WeeWX installation *wee_extension* may need to be prefixed with the path to *wee_extension*.

    This will result in output similar to the following:

        Request to install '/var/tmp/polarwindplot-0.1.0.tar.gz'
        Extracting from tar archive /var/tmp/polarwindplot-0.1.0.tar.gz
        Saving installer file to /home/weewx/bin/user/installer/PolarWindplot
        Saved configuration dictionary. Backup copy at /home/weewx/weewx.conf.20220101124410
        Finished installing extension '/var/tmp/polarwindplot-0.1.0.tar.gz'

3.  Restart WeeWX:

        $ sudo /etc/init.d/weewx restart
        
    or

        $ sudo service weewx restart

    or

        $ sudo systemctl restart weewx

This will result in the *PolarWindPlotTest* skin generating a simple html page that displays each of the four polar plots types that can be generated by the *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* extension. If the WeeWX machine also includes a web server the example page can be viewed in a browser at *http://address/weewx/polarwindplot/index.html* where *address* is the IP address or URL of the WeeWX machine. If no web server is available the individual polar plot files; *dayrose.png*, *dayscatter.png*, *dayspiral.png* and *daytrail.png* may be found in the *HTML_ROOT*/polarwindplot directory.

**Note:** The *PolarWindPlotTest* skin can be used as the basis for a new skin if the *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* is to be used in a production environment. In such cases the *PolarWindPlotTest* skin should be copied and renamed as future updates of the *Polar Wind Plot Image Generator* extension may overwrite the *PolarWindPlotTest* skin.
