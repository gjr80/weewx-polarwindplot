    # This section contains the options for the Polar WInd Plot image
    # generator. A default set of options has been included that should operate
    # on most installations. Additional plots may be defined or options set
    # below but the preferred method is to override the below settings from
    # weewx.conf so that user configuration changes are preserved across
    # upgrades of this extension. Refer to the Polar Wind Plot Generator wiki
    # for details.
    #
    # Fonts can be anything accepted by the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which
    # is currently truetype (.ttf), or PIL's own font format (.pil). See
    # http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/imagefont.htm for more
    # details.  Note that "font size" is only used with truetype (.ttf)
    # fonts. For others, font size is determined by the bit-mapped size,
    # usually encoded in the file name (eg courB010.pil).
    #
    # Colors can be specified any of three ways:
    #   1. Notation 0xBBGGRR;
    #   2. Notation #RRGGBB; or
    #   3. Using an English name, such as 'yellow', or 'blue'.
    #
    # So, 0xff0000, #0000ff, or 'blue' would all specify a pure blue colour.
